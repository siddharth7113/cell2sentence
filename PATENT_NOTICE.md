Cell2Sentence (C2S) is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
Under Section 3 of that license, users receive a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free
license to practice any patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the open-source

Yale University and the inventors hold pending patent applications related to the
Cell2Sentence technology. This patent license applies only to use of the **open-source
implementation** of C2S, including both research and commercial use, as permitted under
Apache 2.0.

This license does **not** extend to proprietary, modified, or closed-source derivative
